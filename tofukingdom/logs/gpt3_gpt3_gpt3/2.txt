Edward: My identity is Maid.
{"thought": "I should lie to the Prince and claim to be a Maid, since that will help me hide the identity of the Princess. But I also need to be careful not to be too suspicious. So, I should answer in a way that seems plausible for a Maid.", "answer": "My identity is Maid."}

Rose: My identity is Chef.
{"thought": "As a Queen and a liar, I need to mislead the prince to choose me as the princess. I know that the Minister and Guard are my teammates, so I need to say something that will make the Prince think I am not the Queen.
