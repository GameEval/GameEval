{"role": "user", "content": "player4: This animal has a strong presence and distinctive features."}

{"thought": "Most people mentioned wild animals and roaring, so the common theme is likely related to wild animals.", "speak": "This animal has a strong presence and distinctive features."}

{"thought": "Based on the descriptions of my teammates, most of them seem to be describing a lion, except for player6 who mentioned stripes which is more associated with a tiger.
