{"thought": "Based on the three previous statements, it seems like it could either be a vehicle or a specific mode of transportation.

"{\"thought\": \"I think player2, 3 and 4 are revealing, so i think they might not be the spy. Player 6's speech is too general and fails to provide any direction, so he is likely a spy.
