{"thought": "It seems everybody is giving very generic descriptions, not giving many clues to guess what they've received. No one has yet given any unique characteristic about their word. Maybe I am the spy, since all the people are giving broad descriptions. Or, maybe they are just trying to mislead me. If I'm not a spy, then there's probably someone who's trying to be extra careful not to slip, while on the other hand, the spy might be trying to blend in with others.", "speak": "This is related to superheroes."}

{"thought": "From the previous talks, I think that the word might be Batman. As for the spy, I'm not entirely sure at this phase, but I'm suspicious of Player 4 as their description seems too vague and he voted for Player 1 who gave more specific description.", "speak": "I agree with player2 that superheroes are a part of this word.", "name": "player4"}

Player 6's statement is more general, but it's still a bit too early to guess who might be the spy. Maybe I should also observe who's trying to be too specific or not giving enough information.", "speak": "I think this is related to crime fighting."}
